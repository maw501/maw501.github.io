Gaussian processes (GPs) can be thought of as a probabilistic yet non-parametric form of non-linear regression which sit within the Bayesian framework.

In this article we give an in-depth introduction to the topic collating many of the excellent references on the topic.

This post combines many sources and so we will try the best we can to be consistent in notation.

In general, capital letters are matrices, bold font represents vectors and lower-case letters are scalars.

* $X_{+}$: test data matrix we wish to predict the target variable for, $n_{+} \times d$
* $\mathbf{x}\_{i}$: $i$th observation of data with $d$ elements
* $\mathbf{x}\_{+}$: single test point with $d$ elements
* $\mathcal{D}$: some data containing both features and target variable, i.e. $\\{X, \mathbf{y}\\}$

We start with some preliminaries which cover some key prerequisite concepts such as kernels, thinking of functions as vectors, a different way to visualize multivariate Gaussians before defining a Gaussian process.

We then walk through the predictive equations for the noise-free case and move onto showing the code and plots for the noisy case which is a simple extension.

Towards the end we detail some helpful mathematical results before a Q and A section which lists some common questions that arise whilst understanding Gaussian processes.

<strong>TLDR:</strong> GPs give a way to express a view on functions. In particular they allow us to specify how smooth we expect a function to be rather than how many parameters we expect it to have. The key idea they rely on is that data points that are close in input space are expected to be similar in output space, i.e. if $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{j}$ are similar then $f(\mathbf{x}_{i})$ and $f(\mathbf{x}_{j})$ will be close in value too.

##### Introduction

Gaussian processes are Bayesian alternatives to kernel methods and allow us to infer a _distribution over functions_, which sounds a little crazy but is actually both an intuitive thing to desire as well as being analytically tractable in certain cases.

Typically in machine learning we have some features $X$ with labels $\mathbf{y}$ and we assume that $\mathbf{y} = f(X)$ for some function $f$. When making this assumption we are typically fixing the parameterisation capacity of the model we wish to use, for example, in linear regression we are assuming there are slope and intercept terms and so the total amount of parameters are fixed given the data.

What if, instead, we wished to think about all possible functional forms for $f$ without pre-specifying how many parameters are involved? It turns this is what Gaussian Processes allow us to do and in return we must specify a prior over the type of functions we wish to see.

##### Kernels and functions as vectors

It is worth briefly explaining a few concepts.

###### Kernels

In the context of Gaussian processes a kernel function is a function that takes in two vectors (observations in $\mathbb{R}^ d$) and outputs a similarity scalar between them. As covariance matrices must be positive semi-definite valid kernels are those that satisfy this requirement. For GPs we evaluate the kernel function for each pairwise combination of data-points to retrieve the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix will end up not only describing the shape of our learned distribution, but ultimately determines the characteristics of the function that we want to predict.

We can go further and say that the problem of learning with Gaussian processes is exactly the problem of learning the hyperparameters of the kernel function. How to learn the kernel hyperparameters is not the subject of this post but is mentioned briefly in the Q and A section [here](#kernel_hyper).

There are many kernels that can describe different classes of functions, including to encode properties such as periodicity. In this post we will restrict ourselves to the most common kernel, the [radial basis function (or Gaussian) kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel):

$$
\kappa(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{x_j}) = \sigma^{2} \exp (-\frac{ \| \mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{x_j} \|^{2}}{2 l^{2}})
$$

with hyperparameters $\sigma$ and $l$. The variance $\sigma^2$ determines the magnitude of fluctuation of values away from the mean and $l^2$ determines the reach of neighbouring data-points (small $l$ will give wiggly functions, increasing $l$ gives smoother functions). See the plot below for the effect of different values of the hyperparameters.

</p>
<em class="figure">Effect of different kernel hyperparameters</em>

Kernel functions are also sometimes referred to as covariance functions.

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Caution:</strong> Gaussian processes get their name because they define a Gaussian distribution over a vector of function values, not because they sometimes use a Gaussian kernel to determine the covariances.
</blockquote>

###### Functions as vectors
Loosely speaking a function can be viewed as an infinitely long vector. We could imagine discretizing the input space with a huge grid of values containing every possible combination of floating point numbers for each dimension of our matrix $X$. Theoretically (but not practically) we could then evaluate $\mathbf{f} = (f(\mathbf{x}\_{1}), ..., f(\mathbf{x}\_{n}))$ for this huge $n$ and so $\mathbf{f}$ would be a very large vector now containing the function's values for the domain of interest.

Alas, we canâ€™t store a vector containing the function values for every possible input (recall each $\mathbf{x_i}$ is $d$ dimensional), though it is possible to define a multivariate Gaussian prior on it. Given (potentially) noisy observations of some of the elements of this vector, it will turn out that we can infer other elements of the vector without explicitly having to represent the whole object.

The miraculous thing about GPs is that they provide a rigorous, elegant and tractable way to deal with the above problem.

Note that whilst talk of functions as vectors can seem a little hand-wavy it can be made rigorous.

##### A different way to view multivariate distributions

In order to aid the discussion on large dimensional Gaussians it's crucial to switch to a different way to visualize them. We start by thinking of each data-point $\mathbf{x_i}$ having $d$-dimensions, so $X$ is $n \times d$ and $\mathbf{x_1}$ and $\mathbf{x_2}$ refer to 2 observations from our data where $\mathbf{y} = \\{y_1, y_2\\}$ is the function value for each data-point.

Using the kernel function we can calculate the covariance matrix, $\Sigma$, between any 2 points (using $X$ only), for example:

$$
\Sigma=\left[ \begin{array}{ll}{1} & {.7} \\ {.7} & {1}\end{array}\right]
$$

and by the assumption we make for GPs (see [below](#gp_defn)) we assume the output function values are jointly distributed according to a Gaussian:

$$
p(\mathbf{y} | \Sigma) \propto \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{y}^{\top} \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{y}\right)
$$

Using this idea it is then possible to visualize what the 2-dimensional Gaussian looks like and draw samples from it. Notice that the covariance between function values is fully specified by the corresponding input values, and not in any way by the actual values of the function; this is a property of the Gaussian Process.

The left hand plots in the below image show contour/density plots for a 2-dimensional Gaussian with a given correlation coefficient (in reality this is calculated by the kernel function) and zero mean vector. The red points shown in the left hand plots are samples from this 2-dimensional Gaussian.

<p align="center">
    <img src="/assets/img/gp_contours.png" alt="Image" width="650" height="500" />
</p>
<em class="figure">A different way to visualize a sample from a 2-dimensional Gaussian</em>

The right hand plots show an alternate way to visualize this sample, where the y-axis represents the value of $y_1$ and $y_2$ respectively. In this way we could easily imagine calculating the covariance matrix between more data-points and plotting a sample in the way shown in the right hand plots, but the left hand plots don't allow this view. This is how we are able to represent multi-dimensional Gaussians on a single plot, as below:

</p>
<em class="figure">A single sample from a multi-dimensional Gaussian</em>


<a name="prelim_plot"></a>
###### Hold on, what's the x-axis for the above plot?

In the above plot we ordered the points according to their index in the covariance matrix but this was simply for illustrative purposes only. In general, the x-axis will be the values of $X$ for which we wish to calculate a point at and thus can take on any real-value. Note once $d > 1$ we can't think of the x-axis as being 1-dimensional any more and so even the above plot breaks down. The input space is simply a  grid (arbitrarily fine if we wish) for which we can calculate function values at.

Nevertheless, when $d=1$ this way of visualizing helps us plot multi-dimensional Gaussians a lot easier and will be helpful for the examples we encounter in the rest of this post.

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Remember:</strong> for GPs the multi-dimensional aspect of Gaussians refers to the number of data-points, not the dimensionality, $d$, of $X$. Once we have computed the covariance matrix via the kernel function we can essentially throw the original $X$ data away.
</blockquote>

##### Probability perspective
Before we start with the equations for GPs we draw a link to traditional modelling in machine learning. Typically in machine learning the Bayesian approach to modelling involves inferring the posterior distribution of the parameters of some model given data, i.e. $p(\theta \| \mathcal{D})$. GPs allow us instead to model $p(f \| \mathcal{D})$ and we can then use this modelled function to predict on new data, $X_{+}$:

<div class="math">
\begin{align*}

\underbrace{p\left(f_{+} | X_{+}, X, \mathbf{y}\right)}_\text{posterior predictive} &= \int \underbrace{p\left(f_{+} | f, X_{+}\right)}_\text{likelihood} \, \underbrace{p(f | X, \mathbf{y})}_\text{posterior} \, df \tag{1} \\[5pt]
&= \int p\left(f_{+}, f | X, X_{+}, \mathbf{y}\right) \, df

\end{align*}
</div>

and so for each new test point in $X_{+}$ we obtain a probability distribution for the corresponding prediction in $f_{+}$. It turns out for the regression case that the above can be done in closed form using known statistical results and linear algebra.

Whilst the above formulation is useful in linking Gaussian processes into the wider Bayesian framework (by showing a likelihood and a prior) it's not typically the most intuitive place to start. For that, it's much easier to start by defining a Gaussian process and rely upon some key properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. These are given [below](#mult_rvs) and assumed from now on - though we will make reference to them as we use them.

<a name="gp_defn"></a>
##### Definition of a Gaussian process
The derivation of the predictive update equations for GPs follow from the definition and assumptions made within it, and this definition is where we will start.

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Definition</strong>
<br>
A Gaussian process is a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> a Gaussian process is completely specified by its mean function and covariance function.
</blockquote>

Thinking of a GP as a Gaussian distribution with an infinitely long mean vector and an infinite by infinite covariance matrix may seem impractical but luckily we are saved by the [marginalization property](#mult_rvs) of Gaussians. That is, the whole thing is tractable as long as we only ever ask finite dimensional questions about functions - these finite points are where we have data or wish to predict.

It is also worth clarifying that in the case of Gaussian processes each data point is a random variable and thus the multivariate Gaussian has the same number of dimensions as the number of data-points: for the training data it is a $n$-dimensional Gaussian. Once we add test data for which to predict the Gaussian will have $n + n_{+}$ dimensions.

We now move onto the predictive equations for the noise-free case.

<hr class="with-margin">
<h4 class="header" id="gp_reg_no_noise">GP regression (noise-free)</h4>

We will walk through a small example with a small amount of data, the below holds for data of any size.

##### Problem set-up
We start by assuming we are given 3 training data-points $\mathcal{D} = \\{ (x_1, f_1), (x_2, f_2), (x_3, f_3)\\}$ and a new test point $x_{+}$ for which we wish to predict $f_{+}$. We assume that the training data has no noise and contains samples from the true unknown function, that is, $f_i = y_i$ for all $i$.

By the definition of a GP it is assumed that any set of random variables, which are the output function values for the data-points, are distributed as a multivariate Gaussian. Given this assumption we can write the joint distribution between our observed training data and the predicted output as:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{f}} \\ {f_{+}}\end{array}\right]
\sim
\mathcal{N}
\Bigg(
\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\boldsymbol{\mu}} \\ {\mu_{+}}\end{array}\right] \, , \,

\left[ \begin{array}{cc}{K} & {K_{+}} \\ {K_{+}^T} & {K_{\\++}}\end{array}\right]
\Bigg) \tag{2}
$$

It is normally common to assume the mean functions are 0 for Gaussian processes, the reasons for why this is are discussed in the Q and A section [below](#mean_modelling).

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Sidebar on the covariance sub-matrices</strong>
<br>

The above sub-matrix $K$ contains the similarity of each training point to every other training point:

$$
K =
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
{K_{11}} & {K_{12}} & {K_{13}} \\
{K_{21}} & {K_{22}} & {K_{23}} \\
{K_{31}} & {K_{32}} & {K_{33}}
\end{array}
\right]
$$

where each entry $K_{ij} = \kappa(x_i, x_j)$ is the evaluation of the kernel function between any two data-points.

Similarly $K_{+}$ is a $3 \times 1$ vector which contains the evaluation of the similarity between each training data-point and the test point $x_{+}$. $K_{\\++}$ in this case is a scalar with the similarity between the test point to itself.
<br>
<br>
The above generalizes to many data points and in general $K$ has dimensions $n \times n$, $K_{+}$ has dimensions $n \times n_{+}$ and $K_{\\++}$ has dimensions $n_{+} \times n_{+}$.
</blockquote>

##### Predictive equations: condition then marginalize

Using the properties of multivariate Gaussians mentioned [above](#mult_rvs) we are able to quickly write down the predictive equations for GPs. Note that in contrast to other Bayesian analysis we do not need to trouble ourselves with computing a posterior explicitly, nor do we need to explicitly perform any integration.

Instead we condition on the observed training data, $\mathbf{f}$, to obtain the posterior predictive (conditional) distribution for $f_{+}$. Using the result for the [conditioning](#mult_rvs) of Gaussians we have, for a single test point:

<div class="math">
\begin{align*}

p(f_{+} | X_{+}, X, \mathbf{f}) &= \mathcal{N}\left(f_{+} | \mu_{+}, \Sigma_{+}\right) \tag{3} \\[5pt]
\underbrace{\mu_{f_{+} | \mathbf{f}}}_\text{predictive mean} &= \underbrace{\mu\left(x_{+}\right) + K_{+}^{T} K^{-1}(\mathbf{f} - \mu(X))}_\text{linear in $\mathbf{f}$} \tag{4} \\[5pt]
\underbrace{\Sigma_{f_{+} | \mathbf{f}}}_\text{predictive uncertainty} &= \underbrace{K_{\\++}}_\text{prior uncertainty} - \underbrace{K_{+}^{T} K^{-1} K_{+}}_\text{reduction in uncertainty} \tag{5}
\end{align*}
</div>

The above conditioning reduces a 4-dimensional Gaussian down to a 1-dimensional Gaussian - we can thus think of the conditioning as cutting 3 slices in the 4-dimensional space to leave us with a 1-dimensional distribution. In general, once we have conditioned on the observed data we will be left with a multivariate Gaussian with dimensionality equal to the number of test points.

To then obtain the marginal distribution of each test point we use the marginalization property of multivariate Gaussians to obtain the mean prediction and variance estimate for each point (in this case there is no need to as we are left with a 1-dimensional distribution for our single test point). In this way the prediction is not just an estimate for that point, but also has uncertainty information - for understanding why knowing uncertainty is important see the Q and A [below](#know_uncertainty).

##### Adding more data

In the above we have 3 observed data points and made a prediction for a new test point. If we wish to predict for more test data we can simply repeat the above steps and thus we are able to get probabilistic predictions for any new test point. In a similar spirit if we observe new training data we can add this in and recalculate the predictions for the test points. (Note this ignores computational considerations to keep things simple.)

##### Walking through an example with plots
We now give an example to illustrate the above discussion.

In this example we are given 3 training data-points $\mathcal{D} = \\{(-2, 1), (1, -1.5), (4, 2)\\}$ and a new test point $x_{+} = 3$ and we wish to predict $f_{+} = f(3)$.

The below chart visualizes parts of the GP fit process and is explained below:

<p align="center">

</p>
<em class="figure">Gaussian process example plots</em>
<hr class="with-margin">

###### Subplot 1: just the data
Without a model and just visual inspecting the 3 training data-points we might guess that $f_{+} \approx 0$ and we would also perhaps expect it to lie in the range around this point. This is an informal way of thinking about the key idea behind GPs - that we expect points that are close in input space to be close in output space also.

###### Subplot 2: sampling from the prior
By defining the kernel function, and before observing any training data, we are specifying a view on how smooth we expect the estimated functions to be. Sampling from the prior amounts to having to specify some domain of interest (here we use -5 to 5) and discretizing it into many points. This is what we loosely mean by saying a function is just a vector of values. This subplot essentially shows a 50-dimensional Gaussian as this is the number of points used along the x-axis - note this creates realistic plots and is a key point. We rarely ever care about every single value our input data can take but just a subset where we have training data or wish to predict.

The data for this subplot is not part of the training data and we just show these samples for illustration. These functions will become constrained once we observe some data.

###### Subplot 3: fit the Gaussian process
Here we have fit the GP regression model and show the outcome. The blue dot is the mean value for the GP prediction and the green dashed line show $\pm 2$ standard deviations around this predicted mean value.

###### Subplot 4: sampling from the posterior
Similar to what we did when we sampled from the prior we can predict the GP for a range of x values, here do it for many points along the x-axis and show the resulting mean vector (red-dashed line) and $\pm 2$ standard deviation estimates for each prediction. Note that where we have observed data the functions from the posterior are constrained to go through the data but in the places where we have no data the possible function fits are many and varied.

##### Comment
Recall that we can represent a function as a big vector where we assume this unknown vector was drawn from a big correlated Gaussian distribution, this is a Gaussian process. As we observe elements of the vector this constraints the values the function can take and by conditioning we are able to create a posterior  distribution for functions. This posterior is also Gaussian, i.e. the posterior over functions is still a Gaussian process. The marginalisation property of Gaussian distributions allows us to only work with the finite set of function instantiations $\mathbf{f} = (f(\mathbf{x}\_{1}), ..., f(\mathbf{x}\_{n}))$ which  constitute the observed data and jointly follow a marginal Gaussian distribution.

<hr class="with-margin">
<h4 class="header" id="gp_reg_noisy">GP regression (noisy)</h4>

Having walked through the noise-free case the extension to the noisy case is straightforward. We now assume that the observed data is a noisy version of the true underlying function and instead we now observe training data $\mathcal{D} = \\{X, \mathbf{y} \\}$ where

$$\mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{x_i}) + \epsilon \tag{6} $$

and $\epsilon$ is additive independent identically distributed Gaussian noise such that $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_y^2)$.

It is still the goal to predict $f_{+}$ for a single test point or $\mathbf{f_{+}}$ for many test points.

Given this noise assumption the only difference in the joint distribution with the noise-free case is on the prior of the noisy observations.

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{y}} \\ {\mathbf{f}_{+}}\end{array}\right] \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0}, \left[ \begin{array}{cc}{K(X, X)+\sigma_{y}^{2} I} & {K\left(X, X_{+}\right)} \\ {K\left(X_{+}, X\right)} & {K\left(X_{+}, X_{+}\right)}\end{array}\right]\right) \tag{7}
$$

where here we are assuming a 0 mean vector.

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Sidebar: covariance of noise term</strong>
<br>
Under the independent identically distributed Gaussian noise assumption assumption only a diagonal matrix is added to the noisy observed terms. We can see this by recalling a property of covariance:

$$
\operatorname{cov}(X+Y, W+V)=\operatorname{cov}(X, W)+\operatorname{cov}(X, V)+\operatorname{cov}(Y, W)+ \operatorname{cov}(Y, V)
$$

and here we have for a single point $i$:

$$
\operatorname{cov}(f(\mathbf{x_i}) + \epsilon, f(\mathbf{x_i}) + \epsilon) = \underbrace{\operatorname{cov}(f(\mathbf{x_i}), f(\mathbf{x_i}))}_\text{$K(X, X)$} +
\underbrace{\operatorname{cov}(f(\mathbf{x_i}), \epsilon)}_\text{= 0} +  
\underbrace{\operatorname{cov}(\epsilon, f(\mathbf{x_i}))}_\text{= 0} +
\underbrace{\operatorname{cov}(\epsilon, \epsilon)}_\text{$\sigma_y^2$}
$$

Similar reasoning means the noise term will not contribute to the $K(X, X_{+}), K(X_{+}, X)$ or $K(X_{+}, X_{+})$ terms.
</blockquote>

##### Predictive equations: noisy case

A similar conditioning argument leads to the predictive equations in the noisy case with 0 mean for a vector of predictions, $\mathbf{f_{+}}$:

As in the noise free case we use the marginalization property of multivariate Gaussians to obtain a mean prediction and variance estimate for each test point in  $\mathbf{f_{+}}$.

Next we move onto something more practical, actually fitting a GP for a noisy regression case!

<div class="math">
\begin{align*}

p(\mathbf{f_{+}} | X_{+}, X, \mathbf{y}) &= \mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{f_{+}} | \mu_{+}, \Sigma_{+}\right) \tag{8} \\[5pt]
\mu_{\mathbf{f_{+}} | \mathbf{f}} &= K_{+}^{T} (K + \sigma_y^2 I)^{-1}\mathbf{y} \tag{9} \\[5pt]
\Sigma_{\mathbf{f_{+}} | \mathbf{f}} &= K_{\\++} - K_{+}^{T} (K + \sigma_y^2 I)^{-1} K_{+} \tag{10}
\end{align*}
</div>

<hr class="with-margin">
<h4 class="header" id="small_example">Algorithm for GP regression</h4>

##### Comments on the above GP fit
* We could technically compute each sample at finer and finer points in the $X$ domain instead of the 50 we did here - this is what we mean by sampling functions.
* All the prior functions are different but come from the same distribution whose covariance (dictated by the choice of kernel and its hyperparameters) controls the smoothness of the functions.
* The prior is over the test points as it's the prior belief for functions before seeing any data.
* Conditioning on data reduces the set of posterior samples to be close to the observed data. As we are observing noisy values of the function the samples will not pass exactly through these points but must come close.
* The uncertainty bands are wide when we have little observed data - this makes sense. This is a function of the kernel hyperparameters and indicates our prior is perhaps too 'wiggly' for the true unknown function. We briefly discuss how to set the kernel hyperparameters [here](kernel_hyper).

##### Multivariate Gaussians - 2 key results

We do not give an exhaustive overview of the many properties of multivariate Gaussians but instead give two key properties which are of paramount importance for the use of Gaussian processes.

<blockquote class="tip">
<strong>Marginalization property: marginal of a joint Gaussian is Gaussian</strong>
<br>
Let $X = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ and $Y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$

be jointly distributed Gaussian random variables:

$$
p(X, Y) = \mathcal{N} \Bigg(
\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mu_X} \\ {\mu_Y}\end{array}\right] \, , \,

\left[ \begin{array}{cc}{\Sigma_{XX}} & {\Sigma_{XY}} \\ {\Sigma_{YX}} & {\Sigma_{YY}} \end{array}\right]
\Bigg)
$$

then the marginal distribution is Gaussian

<div class="math">
\begin{align*}

p(X) &= \int p(X, Y) \, dY \\[5pt]
&= \mathcal{N}(\mu_X , \Sigma_{XX})
\end{align*}
</div>

<strong>Conditioning property: conditional of a joint Gaussian is Gaussian</strong>
<br>
It is also the case that:

$$X | Y \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_{X}+\Sigma_{X Y} \Sigma_{YY}^{-1}\left(Y - \mu_{Y}\right), \Sigma_{X X}-\Sigma_{X Y} \Sigma_{YY}^{-1} \Sigma_{Y X}\right) $$

and so conditioning also gives us a Gaussian.
<br>

</blockquote>

Both of these results will play a key role in Gaussian processes and the use of them will be highlighted when they are encountered. For references on how to derive the above see CS229 notes [here](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/more_on_gaussians.pdf).

##### What is a collection of random variables?

Collections of random variables are stochastic processes, the most common of which is the [random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk). A Gaussian process is a stochastic process such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution.

<a name="mean_modelling"></a>
##### Why is the mean function often set to 0 in the prior?

Even if we set the mean function to 0 in the prior the predicted mean for a test data-point will not be 0. To see this recall the predictive mean becomes:

<div class="math">
\begin{align*}
\mu_{f_{+} | \mathbf{f}} &= \mu\left(x_{+}\right) + K_{+}^{T} K^{-1}(\mathbf{f} - \mu(X)) \\[5pt]  
&= K_{+}^{T} K^{-1}\mathbf{f}
\end{align*}
</div>

even if we set the prior mean function $\mu_i = 0$ for all $i$. Thus the predictive mean depends on the kernel and on the number of training points and so can be arbitrarily flexible. It is worth noting that for predictions far away from the training data and dependent upon the kernel (and its hyperparameters) a GP may still predict $f_{+} \approx 0$ if $x_{+}$ is sufficiently far from the training set. However this is not a bad idea in general and can stop wild predictions due to extrapolation far from the observed data.

Practically when fitting GPs it is desirable to standardize the data (function values, not $X$) to have 0 mean. It can also be advisable to normalize $X$ too depending on the kernel function.

<a name="kernel_hyper"></a>
##### How can we set the kernel hyperparameters?

Pending.

<a name="know_uncertainty"></a>
##### Why is knowing the uncertainty important?

Often in the real-world we care not just about the mean prediction but also the amount by which it could vary. Further, knowing where we are most uncertain is helpful if we have to make a decision about where to next obtain a sample which is expensive to compute. Examples of expensive functions could be drilling a well, conducting a clinical trial or training a large neural network.

Using uncertainty in a probabilistic model to guide search is called Bayesian optimization and is not discussed in this post.

<a name="cholesky"></a>
##### How can we sample from a multivariate Gaussian

Sampling from an arbitrary distribution usually involves computing the CDF of the distribution, which may not be feasible and for a Gaussian there is no closed form solution. However most software packages will have an efficient way to sample from a standard Gaussian, $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

Broadly speaking it will be much more efficient if we can relate everything to a standard Gaussian. In 1-dimension we can use the fact that $x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ can be written as $x \sim \mu + \sigma \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and so sample from a Gaussian with arbitrary mean and variance by sampling from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

To generalize this idea to sample from multi-dimensional correlated random variables $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ we would like to be able to sample from $X \sim \mu + L \, \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ for some $L$. This $L$ needs to be computable and the equivalent to the 'square-root' of the covariance matrix, i.e. a matrix $L$ such that $LL^T = \Sigma$.

$L$ is exactly what the [Cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) gives us.

In this way we can sample from $X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ using $X \sim \mu + L \, \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.

This is a standard result but discussion is provided in [Rasmussen](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf) appendix section A.2.

###### Inverse sampling transform

The idea behind the above relates to the inverse sampling transform algorithm.

##### Why do we assume correlation between observations?

When forming a prior over functions we somehow must define a way to construct a covariance matrix. Clearly we don't want to specify anything manually and we'd like to use the fact that points in input space that are similar have function values that are similar, in other words, the function has some form of smoothness.

If we used a diagonal covariance matrix then it would be the same as saying we believed the function values to be independent and so observing the function in one location would tell us nothing about its values in other locations. Given we usually want to model continuous functions we would like function values for more similar inputs to have large covariances.

##### Why are GPs non-parametric?

To quote [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics#Non-parametric_models):

_Non-parametric models differ from parametric models in that the model structure is not specified a priori but is instead determined from data. The term non-parametric is not meant to imply that such models completely lack parameters but that the number and nature of the parameters are flexible and not fixed in advance._

GPs are non-parametric models and technically have an infinite number of parameters (given by the infinite mean vector and covariance matrix) which are integrated out by the marginalization property of Gaussians.

As we add more data the flexibility and capacity of the model will adjust to fit the data: we would see the mean function adjust itself to pass close to these points, and the posterior uncertainty would reduce close to the observations.

In this way we do not have to worry about whether it is possible for the model to fit the data.
