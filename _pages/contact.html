                <p align="center"> I currently work as a Lead Research Scientist in the R&D team at <a
                        class="reference external" href="https://faculty.ai/">Faculty</a>
                    where I work on large language modelling and before that, probabilistic time-series forecasting.
                    Prior to joining the R&D team I worked on a wide-range of applied machine learning projects,
                    primarily focused on building custom algorithms for
                    real-world business problems - this was usually for Government agencies.

                    <br>
                    Before joining Faculty I spent a long-time (too long!) working in financial markets, mostly focused
                    on asset
                    allocation and risk modelling. During my last few years in finance I was increasingly starting to
                    use tools and techniques
                    from data science and this provided a nice way for me to transition into machine learning.
