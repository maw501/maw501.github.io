                <p align="center"> I'm currently a data scientist at <a class="reference external" href="https://faculty.ai/">Faculty</a> 
                where I work on applied machine learning projects, primarily focused on building custom algorithms and solutions for 
                real-world business problems.

                Prior to joining Faculty I spent a long-time (too long!) working in financial markets, mostly focused on asset 
                allocation and risk modelling. During my last few years in finance I was increasingly starting to use tools and techniques 
                from data science and this provided a nice way for me to transition.
