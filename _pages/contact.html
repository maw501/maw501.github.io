                <p align="center"> I currently work as a technical lead (primarily as a Data Scientist) in the Product team at <a
                        class="reference external" href="https://faculty.ai/">Faculty</a>
                    where I lead cross-functional squads to build and deploy software (mostly focussed on machine learning / data science tooling) into our product, <a
                    class="reference external" href="https://faculty.ai/frontier/">Frontier</a>. Since joining Faculty almost 5 years ago I've 
                    worked in services, R&D and product teams on a wide-range of technical problems. Some examples include: deepfake detection of images, detection of manipulated videos, synthetic data generation using differential privacy, various flavours of discrete-time simulation, Bayesian modelling,
                    probabilistic time-series forecasting and plenty of large-language modelling.

                    Before joining Faculty I spent a long-time (too long!) working in financial markets, mostly focused
                    quantitative investment strategies and risk management. During my last few years in finance I was increasingly starting to
                    use tools and techniques from data science and this provided a nice way for me to transition into machine learning.
