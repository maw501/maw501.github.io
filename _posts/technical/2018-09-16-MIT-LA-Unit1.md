This page is for my conceptual review of the above course, OCW scholar version, link [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/). 

The section will be continually added to in light of applications I come across, most likely with relation to machine learning. The idea is not to be exhaustive in explaining and repeating content that is well documented elsewhere, but rather to provide a personal set of mental hooks for my own use. I expect the interest and application for others to be close to zero.

## Questions reviewing Unit I: Ax = b and the 4 fundamental subspaces

##### Explain the 4 fundamental subspaces for a matrix and their dimensions


##### Explain how the 4 fundamental subspaces are tied to Ax = b
