An open source machine learning course will appear here!

Curated from the best freely available online resources it will provide a landing point to take your machine learning knowledge and skills up to intermediate level.

Jupyter notebooks will be provided.

### Why another machine learning course?

Any course constrained by a single provider is natually limited both in terms of content creation and style of delivery. I fundamentally believe that the way solution to this is to fully open source the learning process and most importantly the content creation process to allow learners to learn in a manner that best suits their learning style.
