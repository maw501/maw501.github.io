Week by week take on the course notes for the ColumbiaX Machine Learning graduate-level course offered through edX as part of their [Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence). This is a comprehensive and theoretical course covering a wide range of the topics in statistical machine learning.

By end-June 2019: will be updated to become more stand-alone and provide code where appropriate.
