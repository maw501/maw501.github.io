My take on the course notes for the ColumbiaX Machine Learning graduate-level course offered through edX as part of their [Artificial Intelligence MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence). This is a comprehensive and theoretical course covering most of the topics in statistical machine learning. Reference texts are [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387310732).
